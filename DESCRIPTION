Package: Rcartogram
Version: 0.2-3
Title: Interface to Mark Newman's cartogram software
Description: Rcartogram is an interface to C code
  for "fitting" diffusion cartograms to a grid
  of densities.  The resulting grid can be used to 
  transform/interpolate values in the original coordinates.
  The result of transforming boundaries for regions with different
  densities is to make the regions in the new coordinates change
  size to be proportional to the original densities. This is used
  for drawing maps, for example, of election vote counts, 
  disease incidences, etc. so that different populations/densities
  are displayed rather than geographical area.
